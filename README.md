# circls-platform

Circls platform monorepo. Fastify backend + Next.js portals (admin, partners). The Flutter consumer app lives separately at [`VedantS01/circls-flutter`](https://github.com/VedantS01/circls-flutter).

## Status

Phase 0 (repo foundation) complete as of 2026-05-19. Implementation begins with Phase 1 (backend skeleton) in the next session. The phased plan is in [`IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`](./IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md) — read it before opening a new session.

## What this is, in one paragraph

A two-app Next.js + one-service Fastify monorepo. The Fastify service in `apps/api` owns all data, business rules, integrations (Razorpay, notifications, object storage), and background workers. The Next.js apps in `apps/admin` and `apps/partners` are thin frontends that call its typed API. Shared TypeScript types live in `packages/api-types`; shared React components in `packages/ui-kit`; shared toolchain configs in `packages/config`. The Flutter consumer app at `circls.app` consumes the same backend via an OpenAPI-generated Dart client.

The `apps/` and `packages/` directories are intentionally empty at Phase 0. Each child is scaffolded in its own phase per [`IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`](./IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md).

## Required reading before contributing

1. [`docs/VISION.md`](./docs/VISION.md) — what Circls is, the four channels, the money flow.
2. [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](./docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) — the five-layer Core, locked tech stack, locked schema decisions.
3. [`IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`](./IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md) — the phased build plan.

## Quick start (once apps exist)

```bash
nvm use                       # Node 24
pnpm install
pnpm dev                      # Currently a stub — wired up in Phase 1
```
